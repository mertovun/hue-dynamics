# Hue Dynamics

Particle Life implementation in C++/SFML.

- Periodic boundary conditions
- Box partitioning based on interaction cutoff distance (r_max).
- Multithreading

Hue interaction matrix is initialized with some degree of randomization favoring the emergence of locomoting bodies (main.cpp).

Check Config.cpp for other simulation and visualization parameters.
